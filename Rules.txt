Always add a valid commit message while committing the code.
After pushing the code it shuld be reviewed. whoever is reviewing the code, can add their comments and send a message. If valid you can change and send to review again. Only after reviewing, the reviewing person can checkin the code

when starting the code, please add comments in the beginning, on the <your name> <question number> : <question> it can be double line comment also. So everytime we merge we can verify all your answers are there. also it wil be easy for the reviewers to check the answers.

Add more comments wherever needed. 

Each of us will concentrate on 5 additional analysis maximum, while doing the questions itself. 

To avaoid last merge conflicts at the end, We will checkin the code daily and merge it to main branch. and pull the data every morning and work on top of it. 

Challenges:
If you find any challange, write down in a file and push it in the main branch, We will use it for presentation. Syntax as <your name>_Challenge

Code Reviews Principles:
Functionality, Labels, Charts, Syntax, Units, Screenshots, etc.
Missing Inline Comments, Spelling mistakes can also be a review point.
